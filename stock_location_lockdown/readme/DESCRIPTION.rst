The aims of this module is to mark locations where no product should transit.
Indeed, in complex warehouse environment, we may have a complicated tree of locations with a lot of virtual ones, used to create the hierarchy of the locations.
We might want to avoid to put stock in these locations since they are not physical locations, they just represent a zone of the warehouse.
For these location, the usage should be internal as it belongs to a warehouse, so the usage 'view' can't be used for these purpose.
