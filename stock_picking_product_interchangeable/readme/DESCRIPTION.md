This module implements "interchangeable" products for Sales Orders. 
If an interchangeable product is not available in stock in sufficient quantity to complete the order its substitute products will be added to picking to complete the order.

**NB:** Interchangeable products substitute each other. Eg if "English Breakfast" can substitutes "Breakfast in England" then "Breakfast in England" can substitute "English Breakfast".
